            <h2>Setup &amp; Knobology</h2>
            <p>Prepare your machine and patient before you begin. Use a probe cover and gel, confirm the indication and explain the exam to the patient.  Here are the common ultrasound probes and basic controls:</p>
            <figure class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="assets/curvilinear_probe.jpg" alt="Curvilinear ultrasound probe" class="ultrasound">
                <figcaption>Curvilinear probe – commonly used for abdominal scanning due to its lower frequency and wider footprint.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Probe types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Curvilinear (2–5 MHz):</strong> Low‑frequency, wide footprint.  Ideal for abdominal and pelvic imaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Phased array (1–5 MHz):</strong> Small footprint.  Used for cardiac windows and between ribs.</li>
                <li><strong>Linear (5–13 MHz):</strong> High‑frequency, rectangular footprint.  Best for vascular access and superficial structures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Orientation and image optimisation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orientation marker:</strong> The probe notch (or light) corresponds to the on‑screen marker.  For longitudinal planes the marker is typically pointed towards the patient’s head; for transverse planes it is pointed towards the patient’s right side.</li>
                <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Adjust so your structure of interest occupies about two‑thirds of the field.  Too deep wastes resolution; too shallow may clip important anatomy.</li>
                <li><strong>Gain:</strong> Start at mid‑range and adjust brightness so structures are visible without loss of detail.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion:</strong> Use <em>sliding</em> (translate), <em>tilting</em> (fanning), <em>rocking</em> (heel‑toe), and <em>rotating</em> to centre and optimise your view.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>eFAST – Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma</h2>
            <p>The eFAST exam screens for intraperitoneal, pleural and pericardial free fluid and for pneumothorax.  It is performed with a low‑frequency curvilinear or phased array probe on a supine patient.  Perform the abdominal views first then finish with thoracic views to keep the probe sterile.</p>
            <figure class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="assets/efast_torso.jpg" alt="eFAST scan positions on a torso mannequin" class="diagram">
                <figcaption>eFAST scan points: RUQ (Morison’s pouch), LUQ (splenorenal recess), suprapubic/pelvic, subxiphoid (pericardial), and bilateral anterior lung apices.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the probe in the mid‑axillary line at the 8th–11th intercostal space; indicator toward the patient’s head.</li>
                <li>Identify the diaphragm, liver and right kidney.  Look for anechoic fluid in Morison’s pouch between the liver and kidney and in the costophrenic recess.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the probe posteriorly at the posterior axillary line; indicator toward the head.</li>
                <li>Identify the spleen, diaphragm and left kidney.  Look for free fluid around the spleen tip, splenorenal recess and subdiaphragmatic space.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Pelvic view</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Position the probe just above the pubic symphysis.  Start transverse with the indicator towards the patient’s right side, then rotate 90° into a sagittal plane.</li>
                <li>Use the bladder as an acoustic window; scan both axial and sagittal planes to assess the rectovesical pouch (male) or pouch of Douglas (female) for free fluid.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cardiac view (subxiphoid)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a phased array probe.  Place just inferior to the xiphoid process with the indicator towards the patient’s right.</li>
                <li>Angle cephalad under the ribs, using the liver as an acoustic window.  Identify all four chambers and look for pericardial effusion or poor cardiac activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lung views</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place a linear or curvilinear probe on the anterior chest at the 2nd–4th intercostal spaces mid‑clavicular or mid‑axillary line with the indicator towards the head.</li>
                <li>Normal lungs show shimmering pleural “lung sliding” and horizontal A‑lines.  Absence of sliding and the presence of a barcode/stratosphere sign on M‑mode indicate pneumothorax.</li>

            <h2>Abdominal Aorta (AAA)</h2>
            <p>AAA screening is performed with the patient supine.  Use a curvilinear probe.  Begin at the epigastrium in transverse orientation with the indicator to the patient’s right and sweep caudally.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify the aorta just anterior to the vertebral body.  Follow it from the diaphragm to the bifurcation.</li>
                <li>Measure the maximal diameter from outer wall to outer wall at proximal, mid and distal segments.  A diameter ≥3 cm is suggestive of aneurysm.</li>
                <li>Rotate into longitudinal orientation (indicator to patient’s head) to confirm aneurysm and assess for dissection or intraluminal thrombus.</li>

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as:
• A diameter ≥ 3.0 cm, OR
• A diameter 1.5 × larger than the normal expected aortic size at that level.</figcaption>

            <h2>Lung Ultrasound</h2>
            <p>Lung PoCUS can identify pneumothorax, pulmonary oedema, consolidation and pleural effusion.  A six‑point scanning technique is commonly used.  Use a linear probe for pleural detail or a curvilinear probe for deeper pathology.</p>
            <h3>Six‑point protocol</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Position the patient supine or semi‑recumbent with arms raised to expose the chest.</li>
                <li>Scan each hemithorax at three points: R1/L1 (anterior mid‑clavicular), R2/L2 (lateral anterior axillary) and R3/L3 (posterior axillary).  Always orient the indicator cephalad.</li>
                <li>Assess for lung sliding, A‑lines (normal), B‑lines (vertical comet tails indicating interstitial oedema), consolidation (tissue‑like lung) and pleural effusion (anechoic fluid above the diaphragm).</li>
                <li>Use M‑mode to differentiate pneumothorax (barcode sign) from normal lung (seashore sign) when uncertain.</li>

            <h2>Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (Echo in Life Support)</h2>
            <p>This is a limited echocardiographic exam performed during resuscitation to answer four key questions: is there cardiac activity, is there pericardial effusion, what is the relative right/left ventricular size and what is the global left ventricular function.</p>
            <h3>Subxiphoid (subcostal) view</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a phased array probe.  Place inferior to the xiphoid with the indicator towards the patient’s right.</li>
                <li>Angle cephalad under the ribs through the liver.  Visualise all four chambers and pericardium.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Parasternal long axis (PLAX)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The PLAX and PSAX windows are obtained from the left parasternal border (left side of the chest).Place the probe just left of the sternum in the 3rd–4th intercostal space; indicator towards the patient’s right shoulder.</li>
                <li>Visualise the left atrium, left ventricle and right ventricle inflow.  Assess left ventricular size and contractility and look for pericardial effusion.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Parasternal short axis (PSAX)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rotate 90° from PLAX (indicator to left shoulder) to obtain a cross‑section of the ventricles at the mitral or papillary muscle level.</li>
                <li>Evaluate right ventricle to left ventricle ratio and regional wall motion.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Apical four‑chamber (A4C)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The A4C (apical four-chamber) view is obtained using the apical window at the cardiac apex, typically found near the left mid-clavicular line at the point of maximal impulse.From the apex (5th intercostal space at the mid‑clavicular line), point the indicator towards the patient’s left.  Obtain all four chambers for comparison of ventricle size and assessment of function.</li>

            <h2>Ultrasound‑Guided Vascular Access</h2>
            <p>Ultrasound can aid intravenous cannulation when veins are not palpable or visible.  A high‑frequency linear probe provides high resolution of superficial structures.</p>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply a tourniquet proximal to the chosen vein to distend it.  Cover the probe with a sterile sheath and apply gel inside and outside the cover.</li>
                <li>Align the probe indicator with the operator’s dominant hand so that needle advancement corresponds with movement on the screen.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Short‑axis (out‑of‑plane) technique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the probe perpendicular to the vessel so it appears as a circle.  Centre the vein on the screen; ensure the artery is identified and avoided.</li>
                <li>Insert the needle at 30–45° just distal to the probe.  Advance slowly, watching for the needle tip as a bright dot entering the vessel.</li>
                <li>Once the tip is in the lumen and blood return occurs, flatten the angle and advance the catheter into the vein.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Long‑axis (in‑plane) technique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rotate the probe so the vessel appears as a tube.  Align the probe along the length of the vein.</li>
                <li>Insert the needle parallel to the probe, maintaining visualisation of the entire shaft and tip.  Advance the catheter into the vein once the tip is visualised within the lumen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sign‑Off &amp; Competency Requirements</h2>
            <p>The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) PoCUS curriculum emphasises that competence is judged on quality and reflection rather than purely numbers.  Nevertheless, indicative numbers help guide training:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>eFAST:</strong> approximately 25 recorded scans with reflective cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Abdominal Aorta (AAA):</strong> approximately 25 recorded scans.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung ultrasound:</strong> approximately 25 recorded scans.</li>
                <li><strong>Focused cardiac (Echo in Life Support):</strong> approximately 10 recorded scans covering subxiphoid and one other view.</li>
                <li><strong>Ultrasound‑guided vascular access:</strong> approximately 10 supervised cannulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These numbers are suggestions; local guidelines may vary.  Always discuss your logbook with a qualified mentor before requesting formal sign‑off.</p>

        <section id="documentation">
            <h2>Documentation &amp; Safety</h2>
            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Record the patient’s name/ID and indication for the scan. • Name of operator and supervising clinician (if performed under supervision)</li>
                <li>Note the probe used, views obtained and any limitations (obesity, gas, poor windows).</li>
                <li>Document key findings (e.g., free fluid present or absent, aortic diameter, B‑lines, ventricular size, vessel patency).</li>
                <li>Store representative still images or clips in the patient record.  Label them with date/time and view description.</li>
                <li>Describe how the ultrasound influenced management or the next step (e.g., CT scan, thoracostomy, resuscitation decisions).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Safety &amp; Governance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Point‑of‑care ultrasound is an adjunct to, not a replacement for, clinical assessment and other imaging.  Negative scans do not rule out pathology.</li>
                <li>Ensure infection prevention: use probe covers, disinfect between patients and adhere to local high‑level disinfection protocols.</li>
                <li>Obtain patient consent where appropriate and maintain dignity during scanning.</li>
                <li>Maintain a logbook of all scans with reflections.  Follow your institution’s credentialing pathway for sign‑off and ongoing revalidation.</li>
                <li>Always consult senior clinicians when uncertain or when scans show unexpected findings.</li>
